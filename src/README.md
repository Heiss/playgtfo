> This is my collection of my knowledge about GTFO. I am a beginner myself for this game, but i want to invest more of my spare time to get better. So i collect here my knowing. I created this, because i think that the [wiki](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/GTFO_Wiki) is not the right place for spoilers or such tips i want to give here. So people can read the wiki and this tips, if they want and ignore the other site. I will give you links to the wiki if it helps to understand and try to avoid duplicates.

If you find errors, have more stuff you want to add or want to discuss i invite you to do it [here](https://github.com/Heiss/gtfo-knowledge-database/discussions). You can create own inputs, too. So please feel free to create pull requests or create discussions.
