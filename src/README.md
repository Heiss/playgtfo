> This is my collection of my knowledge about GTFO. [Feel free to add your knowledge here](https://github.com/Heiss/gtfo-knowledge-database/discussions). I created this, because i think that the [wiki](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/GTFO_Wiki) is not the right place for spoilers or such tips i want to give here. So people can read the wiki and this tips, if they want and ignore the other side. I will give you links to the wiki if it helps to understand and try to avoid duplicates.

If you find errors, have more stuff to add or want to discuss some points, i invite you to do it [here](https://github.com/Heiss/gtfo-knowledge-database/discussions). You can create own inputs, too. So please feel free to create pull requests.
