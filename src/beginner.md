## Enemies

[Wiki](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/Enemies)

First take a look into the wiki for general informations and hints. So you know what you can expect to face. Especially the [Scouts](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/Scout) will you frighten if you do not know or practice how to handle them.

## Doors

[Wiki](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/Security_Doors)

> **Rule of Thumb**: The sleepers spawns 2 rooms(!) away from you and take the shorted path to the security door. Take this to your advantage. [The professor explains it here](https://youtu.be/9XijRULTI-Y?t=263).

This is one of the most common reasons, why a group wipes and quit the game. So be sure, that you know how to defend it. [A good tutorial can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRqQ3rkfenw) and the one in the *rule of thumb* textbox.
