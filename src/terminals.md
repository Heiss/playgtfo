# Terminals

[Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlIEEZgThK4)

## Beginning

First of all: Take a look at the first terminal and check, what you can expect from the map.

Type in `LIST RES` to get all ressources in the level and check for packs, fog repeller, fog turbines etc.
Now you can say, what tactic you can follow: Massive bullets? Stealth? Infection intensive?

Also you can see, where you can find it. If there are a lot of medipacks in a single room, you should write it down and check later, if you need them.
