# Tasks

## Task: Collect Key

Somewhere in the complex you can find a key to open the door. Most times you will find the name of the key if you come close to the door. So the name can be queried via a terminal and (if it is in the same zone as the terminal) can be pinged.

## Task: Collect Cell

This is very equal to [Task: Collect key](#task-collect-key), except one of your team member needs to carry a battery cell to the door, so this member cannot use any weapons or tools while the battery is holding. It can be dropped while pressing and holding e until it is dropped.

## Task: Transport a Box

Instead to collect a cell and enter it somewhere, you have something to bring somewhere. Most times this is an overall task and other tasks supports this one to achieve. Read the text for the current task to know, what you need to deliver where.

## Task: Scan HSU

## Task: Uplink verify

This is easier as it seems. You have to type in `UPLINK_CONNECT <IP>` with the corresponding IP from your tasks to start the sleeper waves. After this you have to type in `UPLINK_VERIFY <VALUE>`. The `value` can be taken from the UI you see, when you are away from the terminal. The yellow printed value is the corresponding key. It is exact the same as a dictionary in programming languages. The terminal gives you the `key` and you have to look up the `value` and type it in.

As long as you do not finish this task, there will be waves of enemies. So you should enter as fast as you can the values, because there is a loading bar between all inputs.

### Tips

For faster typing, you should type in `UPLINK_VERIFY ` (there is a space after the command!!!) and press enter. It is invalid, so nothing happens. But you can access it faster with the up-arrow key on your keyboard after you lookup the `key` and wants to enter the `value`. This can be seen in the second guide video. This is much faster then the first guide video.
