# Before you drop

This is the first phase, if you join or host a lobby.

## Loadout

Most recommended loadout is:

- 1x Biotracker
- 1x C-Foam
- 1x Mine Deployer
- 1x (Burst / Auto) Sentry

With this loadout, you should be able, if you respect the other tips here, to clear all rooms in an expedition and survive most doors.
You should rerun already cleared expeditions with different loadouts to get a feeling for what works and what does not. There are a lot of weapons you can test. 

A good combination is the mine deployer and the c-foam to enhance doors and get some time to fulfill security doors without too many sleepers running at you. After this, the bio tracker gives you a nice triangle to shoot at and the sentry helps you to stagger / decimate the horde. A sentry can be placed before you close and enhance a door, so the (burst) sentry can take down a lot of sleepers without destroying the door. The mine can be a last showstopper, if the sentry is not strong enough. After this, you should encounter only a few sleepers. 

The recommended [weapons](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons) are:

- 1x Sniper as special
- 2x Shotguns as special
- 1-2x with a lot of ammo capacity

Anything else is up to you.

The sniper will be used to take out the scouts and big boys. With the biotracker, you know how many sleepers you need to expect from a room. So sometimes it is better and faster to kill the scout with a single headshot and kill the sleepers with the hammer, so you do not have to deal with a bigger wave if you fail to kill the scout.

The shotguns helps if you have a good chokepoint or big boys in masses of sleepers, so you can take them out with a single shot. This should not happen to often, because your boys with the ammo capacity should take down a lot of sleepers while they running at you.

## Talk about the roles

With the loadout you will choose a role (mix between weapons and tools):

- Supporter (Ground control)
- Damage Dealer (High DPS)
- Single Damage (Handles Big Boys)
- Scout (Bio Tracker)

So you should choose weapons, which plays good with your tools e.g. you should not be at the front if you switch to the bio tracker to track all nearby sleepers. On the otherside you should not combine a sniper special weapon with a extreme short range weapon, so you have nothing to handle targets at the medium range. Shortranges can be handled by your melee weapon. But the shotgun is good in chokepoints and to handle big boys without the sniper (maybe it is currently binded by another enemy).

All teammembers should know its role. All tools shines in some situations and stinks in others. So you want all situations handled by one or multiple teammembers.
