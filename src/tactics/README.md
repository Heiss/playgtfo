# Tactics

GTFO is a first-class strategy ego-shooter like *Ready or Not* or the old *rainbow six* series. So there are a lot of choices you have to make. Sometimes you will not know, that there is a choice. At the beginning you will not know everything about the tools and game mechanics. So you should be ready to rerun the first expedition over and over again with different loadouts and roles.
