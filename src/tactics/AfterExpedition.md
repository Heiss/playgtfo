# After the expedition

You won? Congratulation! Now relax, talk with your teammates and remember the good things.
You lost? Sad. But you made progress with new intel? Perfect. Talk about it with your mates and talk about the good things. What was better then last time?

In both cases you should talk about the tooling: Did you like your role? What are the experiences you made with your weapon of choice? What should be changed in a later run? What you want to try out in a subsequent run.
