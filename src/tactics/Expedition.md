# Drop In

If you choosed a loadout, go down. While you progress the expedition, you will encounter sleepers. So be sure to read [this page](tactics/Encounter.html) to know, how to handle them.

## First run in a new level

If this is your first run in this expedition you should take your [default loadout](/tactics/BeforeDrop.html#loadout) and try to see all rooms and doors in the level. Your primary target is to find all terminals in the zones, this helps you in subsequent runs to find needed items without the need to handle all enemies in all rooms. So you will save health, ammunitions and nerves. Especially if you need to collect something [like a key](tasks.html#task-collect-key).

Use the [checkpoints](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/Checkpoint)  to take a look into all rooms. If you wipe (all members are dead), you take another room next. With this approach, you will clean the fog on your map and see the most of the map. Make a screenshot of the map for subsequent runs. This approach helps you to get a good feeling, if you have to abort the expedition (because someone has to go etc.), because you still making progress with the new intel.

## The first zone

First of all: Take a look at the first terminal in the first zone and check, what you can expect from the map. 

Type in `LIST RES` to get all ressources in the level and check for packs, fog repeller, fog turbines etc.
Now you can say, what tactic you can follow: Massive bullets? Stealth? Infection intensive?

> Tip: You find a terminal in every zones. Type `LIST RES ZONE_XXX` with XXX as the number of your zone to see all ressources in the specified zone.

Also you can see, where you can find it. If there are a lot of medipacks in a single room, you should write it down and check later, if you need them.
